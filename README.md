# 👋 Hi, I'm Indiran

🔌 **Electronics Enthusiast | PCB Design | Embedded Systems | VLSI Explorer**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about electronics, PCB design, VLSI, and embedded systems.  
I enjoy working on projects that bring together hardware, microcontrollers, and digital design.

## 🛠️ What I Work On
- ⚡ **Electronics Projects**: Line follower robot, water level indicator, basic circuits  
- 🔗 **Embedded Systems**: STM32 (STM32F103 with CubeIDE), ESP32/ESP32-C3, communication protocols  
- 🖥️ **VLSI Design**: Verilog HDL coding, backend circuit design

## 📂 Featured Projects
- 💧 **Water Level Indicator** – simple circuit to monitor water levels without the use of sensors and just basic electronics  
- 🤖 **Line Follower Robot** – A bot that automatically follows a line, without any external controls  
- 📟 **Temperature Controlled AC Remote** – A custom DIY AC remote that senses the temperature and sends on/off signal to AC accordingly
