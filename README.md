# 👋 Hi, I'm [Your Name]

🔌 **Electronics Enthusiast | PCB Design | Embedded Systems | VLSI Explorer**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about electronics, pcb design, VLSI, and embedded systems.  
I enjoy working on projects that bring together hardware, microcontrollers, and digital design.

## 🛠️ What I Work On
- ⚡ **Electronics Projects**: Line follower robot, water level indicator, basic circuits.
- 🔗 **Embedded Systems**: STM32 (STM32F103 with CubeIDE), ESP32/ESP32-C3, communication protocols
- 🖥️ **VLSI Design**: Verilog HDL coding, RTL design, synthesis & simulation.

## 📂 Featured Projects
- 💧 **Water Level Indicator** – simple circuit to monitor water levels without the use of sensors and just basic electronics.
- 🤖 **Line Follower Robot** – A bot that automatically follows a line, without any external controls.
- 📟 **Temperature controlled AC remote** – A custom diy aC remote that senses the temperature and sends on/off signal to AC accordingly.
